This application can record picks for sports games to be used as a sort of bracket to see who gets more correct. You can create groups, choose the sport and manage the scoring format to customize you experience.

V1 only supports NFL games, but future enhancements are planned and will be rolling out shortly after initial release.

Please submit bugs to our official GitHub.

Feel free to branch the repository or clone it for your own personal improvements.
